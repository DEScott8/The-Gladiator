# The-Gladiator
An experiment in OOP, designed in Python.

This is an unfinished project that I made in Python to play around with OOP concepts. I'll be studying this in my free time for other purposes, but the basics of RPG elements exists within the player character. The boss fight is in the game and should be accessible through 
a cheat code of sorts. Fights are simply 1-on-1, but I wanted to eventually have entire parties of characters, and even was planning to implement mercenaries at some point (Thanks to Yuri for this suggestion!). This is about as far as I desire to take it in Python. Any 
development on this project will be ported over to C# and possibly Rust/Kotlin.
